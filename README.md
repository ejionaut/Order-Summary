## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was finally able to properly center the focus of the page. 
Using the ff on the body acting as a container:

```css
body{
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
```

As well as learn about CSS reset
using the ff:
```css
  img,
  svg {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
```

### Continued development

From this point, I will start learning JavaScript to further increase the styles and functions of the websites!
